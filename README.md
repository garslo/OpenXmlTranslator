# OpenXmlTranslator

OpenXmlTranslator is a library that aims to convert
[Office Open XML][OpenXml] (OpenXML) (as found in Microsoft Word) to various
formats. So far there is partial conversion of the mathematics subset
of OpenXML to [LaTeX][LaTeX].

# Docs & Explanations

Check the [wiki!][wiki]

# Requirements

OpenXmlTranslator requires the [Open XML SDK][OpenXmlSdk] to be installed.

# Why?

I'm writing this for two reasons:

1. To learn C# and the .NET framework a bit better
2. To improve accessibility for mathematics in Word documents
